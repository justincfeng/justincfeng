- Hi, I’m @justincfeng
- I’m interested in general relativity and spaceflight.
- I'm currently learning about SciML.
- I’m looking to collaborate on topics related to general relativity, relativistic positioning, modified gravity, and SciML in gravitation.
- You may contact me at justin.feng@tecnico.ulisboa.pt
